                                    Yes, we know that every business has its own risk, either systemic or
                                    non-systemic. At <strong> Quebec FOODPRO IP,</strong> security of investment and safety of
                                    investors’ trust are taken with utmost importance. In other words, we know,
                                    understand and agree that we are investors’ trust bank, and we will
                                    therefore not compromise this fragile relationship. This has made us to

                                     <strong>(NAIC)</strong> and Leadway Insurance as a means of risk management and mitigation.

                                    you can submit an “indication of interest.” An indication
                                    of interest is similar to a reservation. It’s a non-binding
                                    commitment that allows you to be placed on a waitlist for 
                                    any offerings that are oversubscribed, meaning they have 
                                    raised more than their maximum funding goal. This is not an investment and does not guarantee a place in the offering.
